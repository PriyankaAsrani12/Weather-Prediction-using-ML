# Weather-Prediction-using-ML

### Problem Statement : 
##### This project aims to predict the weather using parameters as sunshine, humity , sea level and so on.Using various classification algorithms such as Decision Tree , Logistic Regression , Support Vector Machine we aim to predict the various cloud patterns based on dataset with good accuracy.

#### Softwore used : Google Colab

#### Libraries used : Numpy, pandas, Matplotlib, Sklearn. 

# Results:
| Algorithm               |    Accuracy   |
| -------------           | ------------- |
| Decision Tree           |      85%      |
| Logistic Regression     |      85%      |
| Support Vector Machine  |      80%      |
